# PythonChallenge.com Challenges

My progress so far with the programming challenges on pythonchallenges.com

## Description

I've included each challenge in its own folder with the necessary input media (txt files, images, etc.). Where the output is only text, I have included that in the .py file as comments at the end. If the output is an image or a sound file, I have included the output as its own file in the appropriate folder.

### Quite the challenging set of problems that get progressively more difficult. For areas I was less familiar with, I used google and stackoverflow to assist me, and for the very difficult problems I looked at the hints [on the forum](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/python-challenge)
